    <h2>Geo4LibCamp2020</h2>

Geo4LibCamp 2020 was held Monday, February 3 - Wednesday, February 5 2020.
Following the camp, on Thursday and Friday, we had optional post-conference working sessions.

In addition to the working sessions, a relevant IIIF and Maps meeting tool place.

<h3>Agenda</h3>
The main event will be a 3 day unconference on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, followed by an optional 2-day working session on Thursday and Friday. We will have a dinner on Monday evening, a catered lunch on Monday, and coffee/snacks each day.

<h3>Travel and Lodging</h3>
Stanford University is located in Palo Alto, CA which is near both San Francisco Airport (SFO) and San Jose Airport (SJC). The campus is connected to the Palo Alto Caltrain station and the campus itself has a free shuttle service called Marguerite. From the train station, you can take the P shuttle to the "Campus Oval" or the X / Y shuttles to elsewhere on campus.  There is limited visitor parking available on campus. Lyft, Uber, taxis, and metro buses are available too.

We recommend the Cardinal Hotel in downtown Palo Alto.

<address>
<a href="http://www.cardinalhotel.com">Cardinal Hotel</a>
235 Hamilton Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94301
<a href="tel:+16503235101">(650) 323-5101</a>
</address>
</p>

<p>
Aside from the Cardinal Hotel, there are numerous lodging options near campus and along the Caltrain route. The lodging expenses vary quite a bit in Palo Alto and the surrounding areas as we are located in the heart of Silicon Valley. Downtown Palo Alto (along University Avenue) is the most convenient location as it’s a short walking distance to the Palo Alto train station, campus, and to many restaurants. Try Kayak, Yelp, Airbnb, etc. to identify lodging options in the mid-Penisula region.

<h3>Event Location</h3>
The main event will be held at the Hartley Conference Center located on the 1st floor of the Mitchell Earth Sciences Building (at 397 Panama Mall, Stanford, CA), which is near to the main quad on the Stanford University campus. The Branner Earth Sciences Library is just upstairs from our meeting room. The building is on the route of the X / Y / SLAC shuttles, or walking distance from the Campus Oval on the P shuttle route.
The post-conference sessions will be held on the 3rd floor of Lathrop Library, which is adjacent to the Campus Oval.

<h3>Sunday Night Dinner</h3>
If you’re in town Sunday night (February 2nd) and want to grab dinner, we will meet in the lobby of the Cardinal Hotel (235 Hamilton Ave) at 6pm. There are several great restaurants a short walking distance from the hotel.

<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.
