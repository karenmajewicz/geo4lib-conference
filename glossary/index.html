<div class="container">
<div id="accessioning">
<h4>Accessioning</h4>
<p>This term is used broadly to describe adding new items to a collection. It is most commonly used in archives and museum terminology, particularly for assigning &quot;accession&quot; numbers to denote when/from where an item was obtained. Digital accessioning can include the concept of a re-accession, for when digital items have been updated or corrected in some way and need to be processed again.</p>
</div>

<div id="api">
<h4>API</h4>
<p>Application Programming Interface. Broadly defined, an API is how different software applications can talk to each other and share information. In library practice, this usually takes the format of a JSON file URL that can be accessed by a script for harvesting data, metadata, or schema information.</p>
</div>

<div id="arcgis-metadata">
<h4>ArcGIS Metadata</h4>
<p>The current proprietary format used by ArcGIS. It contains all elements required for either FGDC or ISO (as well as other profiles). It also contains technical information specific to the ArcGIS environment, such as thumbnails. Also referred to as ArcGIS 10 metadata.</p>

Heterogenous data discovery is supported, but not geospatial.
<a href="http://projectblacklight.org/">http://projectblacklight.org/</a></p>
</div>

<div id="bounding-box">
<h4>Bounding box</h4>
<p>A bounding box delineates the geographic extent of a given spatial dataset, and is typically concieved as the smallest hypothetical rectangle that would fully enclose the features of a spatial dataset. It is defined by four coordinates: the hypothetical rectangle&#39;s minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude, and maximum latitude. These coordinates correspond, respectively, with the hypothetical rectangle&#39;s leftmost line, its bottom, its rightmost line, and its top. A dataset&#39;s bounding box is an important component of geospatial metadata. Note that it is often also referred to as an envelope.

</div>

<div id="geojson">
<h4>GeoJSON</h4>
<p>GeoJSON is a specific type of JSON for encoding spatial data. As an open standard, it is endorsed by preservation organizations, such as the Library of Congress. However, it can be unwieldy for large datasets, as it is a flat file format, not a database. NOTE: a common misconception is that the GeoBlacklight metadata schema uses GeoJSON. This is incorrect - it uses JSON with a few geospatial-related elements. There is also a TopoJSON that extends geoJSON to include topology. However, TopoJSON is not yet an endorsed standard.

<div id="groundhog-day-references">
<h4>Groundhog Day references (and why we have them)</h4>
<p>Geo4Lib Camp has always been held just before or just after February 2, Groundhog Day. During one conference, a plan for a speaker fell through at the last minute, and the Geo4Lib Camp organizers asked several attendees, including Andrew Battista, to give an impromptu talk. Andrew has a long personal tradition of writing essays that apply some academic discipline or critical method to the film Groundhog Day (1993). Andrew gave a talk on a Spatial Humanities reading of the film, and while strange, the talk was well-received. It has become somewhat of a tradition for Andrew to give a short talk each year about Groundhog Day. See the 2020 talk at <a href="http://tiny.cc/groundhog2020/">

<div id="open-source-software">
<h4>Open-source software</h4>
<p>A software application is considered open source if its source code is freely available to users, who can expand, adapt, modify, and distribute this code as they see fit. Open source software is typically developed collaboratively; as a result, it is important to be able to systematically track changes to the codebase, and to track different versions of a project that result from these changes. Git is a version control system that facilitates collaboration on open-source projects (such as the Geoblacklight project) by allowing participants to essentially track changes and follow each others&#39; work. Github is a web platform that allows users to collaborate on open-source projects using the Git version control system. In the context of Github, a pull request is a procedure wherein someone who wishes to make changes to a project&#39;s codebase requests a member of the project team to review these proposed changes; if the reviewer approves these changes, they become incorporated (or merged) into the main codebase.

<div id="openindexmaps">
<h4>OpenIndexMaps</h4>
<p>OpenIndexMaps is a specific index map standard (encoded in GeoJSON format), that is used by the GeoBlacklight community.

<div id="postgis-postgres">
<h4>PostGIS and PostGres</h4>
<p>Postgres, also known as PostgreSQL, is a free and open-source object-relational database management system (RDBMS). Its purpose is to manage data, no matter whether datasets are large or small, in an extensible environment where developers can customize its functionality with data types, functions, etc. PostGIS is an extension of PostgreSQL that adds support for geographic objects.

<div id="projections">
<h4>Projections</h4>
<p>In order to make a map, one has to represent the three-dimensional surface of the earth on a two-dimensional plane. There are different ways in which one might flatten the earth to represent it on a two-dimensional map, and these different flattening algorithms (all of which involve distortions of one kind or another) are referred to as map projections. Most maps published on the web are in the Web Mercator projection. Related terms: CRS (coordinate reference system) or the older term SRS (spatial reference system)

<div id="research-licensed-open-data">
<h4>Research, licensed, and open data</h4>
<p>Research data refers to data that has been collected and compiled by researchers affiliated with a given institution (and often released in conjunction with a publication or journal article). Licensed data is data (or a particular interface to data) that an institution (i.e. an academic library) purchases for use by its affiliates. Openly available data (for instance, municipal data) is data that was neither purchased by an institution nor created by its researchers, but which is freely available to the public, and therefore often ingested or indexed by academic libraries to facilitate discovery and preservation. </p>

<h4>Solr</h4>
<p>Solr, or Apache Solr, is an open-source enterprise search platform writtin in Java. It runs as a standalone full-text server with faceted search, real-time indexing, dynamic clustering and database integration capabilities. It has a configuration that allows for connection to many applications without Java coding and architecture for further customization. It is the indexing system that sits under Blacklight.

<div id="spatial-data-infrastructure-components">
<h4>Spatial data infrastructure components</h4>
<p>A spatial data infrastructure is a digital apparatus (comprised of interconnected applications and repositories) that facilitates geospatial data storage, discovery, and long-term preservation. Geoblacklight is an application that allows users to discover geospatial data, access relevant metadata, preview layers, and download GIS datasets. Geoserver is an open-source server that allows for GIS data sharing; more specifically, in the context of the Geoblacklight application, it facilitates layer previews and downloads. Institutions that use Geoblacklight as a spatial data discovery platform typically also preserve these underlying datasets in the context of an institutional repository, as well as share relevant metadata through OpenGeoMetadata (a metadata repository that allows institutions to index geospatial data owned by other institutions, and hence data discoverable on their local Geoblacklight instances). There are many moving parts in a spatial data infrastructure; for a more detailed explication of these parts and how they fit together, see the narrative description authored by NYU Data Services.

<div id="sprints">
<h4>Sprints</h4>
<p>Sprints refer to an intensive period of time (usually 1-2 weeks) set aside to make significant progress on something. This is a popular concept in many software development practices, such as Scrum. The GeoBlacklight community holds sprints two times per year, and many institutions hold local sprints for their own applications. Although sprints are often thought of as for coding and development, the GeoBlacklight community follows a model in which sprints can address any type of issue, from documentation to metadata to governance and more.</p>
