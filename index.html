    <h2>What is Geo4LibCamp?</h2>
    <p>
	Geo4LibCamp is an annual unconference hosted at Stanford University. A three day unconference, followed by two working days to collaborate, learn, and make progress on unconference sessions.
	</p>
	<p>
	Due to ongoing public health uncertainties, we have made the difficult, but necessary decision to postpone the Geo4LibCamp 2022 Unconference.
	In lieu of a week-long conference, we are planning a Community Day to be held on February 2, 2022. Groundhog Day!  This one-day virtual event will include some familiar programming as well as give us a chance to check-in and hear from everyone.
	One major advantage of last year's virtual event was the increased capacity for participation. We hope to maintain that enthusiasm and flexibility using hybrid approaches in all future events. However, in-person gatherings are one of the highlights of our unconference, and our community at large. We are looking forward to the opportunity for us all to see one another, interact, and collaborate.

        Here&rsquo;s a good place to list the organizers and sponsors of the conference,
        as well as list contact information for the organizers,
        and show off the logos of the sponsors.
        It looks like his conference was sponsored by kittens!
